  <h1 align="center">Beyond Imagination: Boosting Diffusion Model with Adaptive Face Reference //for Realistic Speech-to-Face Generation</h1>

### ðŸ”¥Highlight!!

[1] A novel speech-conditioned diffusion-based network is proposed for speech-to-face generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop speech-only driven LDM for this task. 
[2] To learn paired speech-face information and detailed face representation, we propose a collaborative pre-training procedure with face reconstruction to align speech and face representation and reconstruct facial structures simultaneously.
[3] We introduce a novel sample adaptive face reference into LDM to alleviate its noise sensitivity and generate a realistic face image that conforms to the corresponding speech.
